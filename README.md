##💳 Neon Credit Card UI

##✨ Overview

This project is a visually striking, fully interactive front-end clone of a virtual credit card, designed with a modern, neon glow aesthetic. It's built exclusively with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript), making it an excellent example for mastering advanced CSS styling techniques, responsiveness, and basic DOM manipulation.

##🚀 Features

Vibrant Neon Glow: Achieved entirely through CSS effects to give the card a futuristic, floating appearance.

Realistic Layout: Mock data fields for Card Number, Cardholder Name, and Expiry Date.

Interactive Buttons:

Buzz Card: Triggers a subtle visual animation on the card element.

Copy Number: Copies the credit card number to the user's clipboard using Vanilla JS.

Copy Support: Placeholder for future utility or support contact information.

Responsive Design: Ensures the card looks great on all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.

##🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5: Structure and content.

CSS3: Styling, custom properties, and advanced effects (box-shadow, text-shadow).

Vanilla JavaScript: Core logic for interactivity (e.g., copying text).
